# madlib
This program will generate a madlip story from user prompts

**Author**: Chris Ball - working closely with Paul Williamsen, after hours of spinning our wheels.
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This app will read a text file, create a string from that file, find all occurances of text inside {} and generate prompts for user input, then it will user the user input to replace all {} and print the new string to a new file.

## Getting Started
Run the program and respond to all prompts. Read the resulting story.

## Attribution
Paul Williamsen and I worked on this together for a few hours. We found some uses of various string methods online that proved very helpful. (.findall() being the real lifesaver)
